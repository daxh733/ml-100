# üöÄ 100 Days of Machine Learning Journey üöÄ
Welcome to my personal journey through the #100DaysOfMachineLearning challenge! This repository is a chronicle of my daily progress, learnings, and projects as I dive deeper into the fascinating world of Machine Learning. My goal is to build a solid foundation, tackle diverse problems, and consistently code every single day.

# ‚ú® About This Repository
This repository serves as a living log of my daily efforts in Machine Learning. Each day, you'll find:

Daily Learning Notes: Key concepts, theories, and algorithms I'm studying.
Code Implementations: Hands-on exercises, mini-projects, and algorithm implementations from scratch.
Project Solutions: Complete projects, often focusing on real-world datasets and problems.
It's a testament to consistency and the power of incremental learning in mastering complex fields.

# üéØ What You'll Find Inside
The repository is structured to reflect the daily progression, with dedicated folders for each day's work. You'll explore various facets of ML, including:

Data Preprocessing & Cleaning: Techniques to prepare raw data for model training.
Feature Engineering: Creating impactful features from raw data.
Core ML Algorithms: Implementations and applications of models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and more.
Natural Language Processing (NLP): Working with text data, including techniques like TF-IDF vectorization and sentiment analysis. (Yes, the Movie Review Sentiment Analyzer is here!)
Model Evaluation & Tuning: Understanding metrics, cross-validation, and hyperparameter optimization (GridSearchCV).
Model Deployment Basics: Taking a trained model and serving it via a simple web application (like the Streamlit app you just built!).
